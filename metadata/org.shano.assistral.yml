Summary: WebView wrapper for Mistral Le Chat

Description: |-
    Assistral is a simple WebView wrapper for Mistral Le Chat. It blocks all URLs which are not essential for functioning.

    Features:
    * Secure WebView wrapper for Mistral's Le Chat AI assistant
    * URL blocking to prevent tracking and unnecessary requests
    * Toggle button to switch between restricted and unrestricted mode
    * Support for file uploads and downloads
    * Voice input support for conversations
    * Clean, minimal interface focused on the chat experience

    The app does not support login via Apple, Microsoft, or Google account - please use a web browser for initial sign up if needed.

    You can switch URL blocking on/off by clicking the button at the top right. Swipe up a bit to hide the button for a cleaner view.

    This app provides a focused, privacy-conscious way to access Mistral's powerful AI chat interface without the distractions and tracking of a full web browser.
